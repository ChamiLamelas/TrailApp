# Trail App 

The purpose of this project is to create the base of an Android app for the [Greater Worcester Land Trust](http://www.gwlt.org/) with the intention for them to continue with it in the future. This project was done as part of a larger group of community service projects run by [Bancroft School](https://www.bancroftschool.org/index.cfm) . Please note that this project is still in the BETA stage.

The app contains the following features: 

* The overall map of all GWLT properties. 
* A list of regions of properties and their respective maps and properties. 
* The ability to send a report on each property whether it is a problem or a sighting. 
* The ability to "see more" about the property such as previous sightings. 

## How to Use the Project 

In addition to these steps, the source code (both Java and XML) is thoroughly documented. 

### Prerequisites

In order to edit this project, you need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) which provides the ability to edit both Java and XML code.

### Installing

Once you have installed [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) for your platform, you will have to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the .zip file of the repository and open the project. 

### Editing Project

Some features, that are primarily for GWLT, such as adding new regional maps and properties has been made easy and don't require an extensive knowledge of Java or XML. However, for larger edits to how the system works, a more extensive knowledge may be required. 

## Testing the Project

The code can be tested using the emulator built into Android Studio or an actual Android device. To familiarize yourself with Android Studio it may be useful to first the tutorials for [building your first app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/) provided by Android.
