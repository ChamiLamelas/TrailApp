# Trail App 

The purpose of this project is to create the base of an Android app for the [Greater Worcester Land Trust](http://www.gwlt.org/) with the intention for them to continue with it in the future. This project was done as part of a larger group of community service projects run by [Bancroft School](https://www.bancroftschool.org/index.cfm) . Please note that this project is still in the BETA stage.

The app contains the following features: 

* The ability to navigate the various levels of maps starting with a map of all GWLT properties, then to regional maps, then to 
individual property maps. 
* The overall map will have a list of regional maps and then each regional map has a respective list of properties. 
* For each individual property, the ability to use the GWLT's existing trail monitoring report as well as the ability to send an image of a report through email.
* The app also contains various bits of information such as a link to more information on each individual property in addition to information about GWLT and becoming a member. 

## How to Use the Project 

In addition to these steps, the source code (Java and XML) is thoroughly documented for the purpose of making it easy to use. 

### Prerequisites

In order to edit this project, you need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) which provides the ability to edit the Java, XML, and Gradle code. 

### Installing

Download the repository as a .zip file and extract the files. Once you have installed [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) for your platform, you will have to navigate to the directory where you extracted the .zip file of the repository and open the project that [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) will show you. 

### Editing Project

Some features, that are primarily for GWLT, such as adding new regional maps and properties have been made easy and don't require an extensive knowledge of Java or XML. However, for larger edits to how the system works, a more extensive knowledge may be required. 

## Testing the Project

The code can be tested using the emulator built into Android Studio or an actual Android device. To familiarize yourself with Android Studio it may be useful to first the tutorials for [building your first app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/) provided by Android.
